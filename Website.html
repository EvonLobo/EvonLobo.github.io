<h1> WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF GIVING! </h1> 
  <hr>
  
<p> This is a website that demonstrates an application I would like to develop in the future. It's solely to help people through donations. There's food that goes to waste everyday but is not used. I would like to make use of the same in order to satisfy hunger of the poor and needy. Every single one of you can contribute, and make a difference in the lives of many people. </p> 
<br>
  <h3> Here's how it works:</h3>
<ol>
<li> The application will have a "sign up" for those interested in taking part. </li>
  
<li> Once signed up, a scheduled meeting will be held with the company I run, for official reasons, and also in order to
      particularly meet each giving client to share our token of appreciation. </li>
  
<li> Any company or even an individual is most welcome. </li>
  
<li> Once a contract is set between both parties, it works easy. </li>
  
<li> For each time there is a minimal amount of food, a food company wants to share, even an individual, there will be a quick and easy "alert" signal that asks the name of the company or person, and what and how much food they hold at this point. </li>
       
<li> Once our company is notified, and the client is verified, a food truck will be sent to collect the food. </li>
  
<li> This food will be delivered to those found on streets, homeless and the needy. Shelters for the homeless, and 
        organisations that help such people, will be given a part of the share in order to serve the hungry. </li>
  </ol>
