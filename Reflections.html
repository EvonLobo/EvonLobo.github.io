<p>This is a document about what I learned during my mentorship with Deep Dive Coding. </p>

<h3> Start with "Why" - The Golden Circle </h3>  
<p>Before we get started about what we want to do, letâ€™s talk about why and how. The main aim of my project is to use my growing software knowledge for something worthwhile and beneficial for the society we live in. To connect to people personally, help those in need, satisfy hunger for those lacking daily intake requirements. This idea answers the main and big question, WHY. Since, I would like to do so based on my knowledge in software, I would have to develop skills to learn web languages, learn the steps it would take to reach my main goal i.e. to help the hungry, be responsible for my own ideas and take appropriate actions in achieving the same. That answers the second question, HOW. The central idea is to build an application that connects various food companies to my own. After the legal procedures, I would like the company to work this way; once a food company has a minimal amount of food that is unused but still going to waste, I would like them to alert my own company through the app. Certain food pick-up trucks will be sent to fetch this food, and will then be handed over to those lying on streets, or certain organizations sheltering the needy. I would like to lend my hands as much as I can. <p>

  <dt>URL:</dt>
  <dd>Universal Resource Locator (web address) </dd>
  <dt>Branch:</dt>
  <dd>A branch is an instruction on a computer program that can cause a computer to begin executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its default behavior of executing instructions in order. </dd>
  <dt>Commit :</dt>
  <dd> The making of a set of tentative changes, permanent. </dd>
  <dt>Push :</dt>
  <dd> A server push can be used to send news data, stock updates, and other information from the internet to the user's computer. (Push data from the client to the server) </dd>
  <dt>Pull: </dt>
  <dd> Specially requesting information from a particular source. Downloading a web page from a web browser is an example. </dd>

  <dd> Debugging is the process of finding and resolving defects or problems within the program that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. </dd>
  <dt>Cache :</dt>
  <dd> A hardware or a software component that stores data so future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation, or the duplicate of data stored elsewhere. </dd>

  <dt>Phishing:</dt>
  <dd> Sending spam email to get personal information. </dd>
  <dt>Database:</dt>
  <dd>  It is a computer software application that interacts with end users, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. </dd>
  <dt>Server:</dt>
  <dd> A server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices called "clients." </dd>
  <dt>Client:</dt>
  <dd> A distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers if a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. </dd>
  <dt>Encryption:</dt>
