<h2> The Golden Circle </h2>

<h3> Why? How? What? </h3> 
<p> Before we get started about what we wanna do, lets talk about why and how. The main aim of my project is to use my growing software knowledge for something worthwhile and beneficial for the society we live in. To connect to people personally, help those in need, satisfy hunger for those lacking daily intake requirements. This answers the main and big question, WHY. Since, I would like to do so based on my knowledge in software, I would have to develop skills to learn web languages, learn the steps it would take to reach my main goal i.e to help the hungry, be responsible for my own ideas and take appropriate actions in achieving the same. That answers the second question, HOW. The central idea is to build an application that connects various food companies to my own. After the legal procedures, I would like the company to work this way; once a food company has a minimal amount of food that is unused but still going to waste, I would like them to alert my own company through the app. Certain food pick-up trucks will be sent in order to fetch this food, and will then be handed over to those lying on streets, or certain organisations sheltering the needy. I would like to lend my hands as much as I can. <p>
