<h2> A little insight before we get started: </h2>

<p> The main purpose of this project is to use technology in a way that could help our own people. As the world is almost fully dependent on technology, I thought it would be best to learn and use this knowledge of coding into making something useful. This website on one hand, is all about my learning processes, and the other is my product, which you will learn more about, soon!</p>
